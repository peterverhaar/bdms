        <br/>
        The questions test your understanding of the concepts and the techniques that have been explained in the first five weeks of the Digital Media Technology course. Read all the questions very carefully and motivate your answers as fully as possible. The answers to these questions need to be given in a separate document. Do not forget to write your name in the document that you submit, and name the file [your surname]-DMT_assignment1, in accordance with the BDMS Style Sheet. Note that this instruction does not apply to the XML file that you submit for this assignment. The TEI document should be named following the rules that are explained in the BTC guidelines!The four questions can be awarded 2.5 points each.

              <li>There is an important difference in principle between the following two examples of markup. What is the crux of that difference and why is it important? [<em>maximum word count (mwc): 150</em>]<br>

<i>Fragment 1</i>

                 &lt;opener&gt;   <br/> &lt;date value=”18720213″&gt;13 February 1872&lt;/date&gt;   <br/>&lt;salute&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/salute&gt; &lt;/opener&gt;   <br/> &lt;p&gt;I have just received your translation of the &lt;title&gt;Camera Obscura&lt;/title&gt;, for which many thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

                <i>Fragment 2</i>

                 &lt;p align=”right”&gt;13 February 1872&lt;/p&gt;  <br/> &lt;p align=”left”&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/p&gt;   <br/>&lt;p align=”left”&gt; I have just received your translation of the &lt;i&gt;Camera Obscura&lt;/i&gt;, for which many thanks.&lt;/p&gt; <br>

              </li>
        
          <li>There is a long-standing tradition of regarding content and form as two sides of one medal: the content needs to be reflected in form, and the form confers authority on the content. In what ways does the emergence of XML challenge this traditional view of texts as recorded forms in which content and appearance are inseparable? <em>[mwc: 200]</em></li>

<br/>
          <li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>What is the relation between XML and TEI? <em>[mwc: 100]</em></li>
              <li>What is the relationship between a document instance (such as, for example, the TEI-transcription of a letter from archive of De Erven F. Bohn) and a Document Type Definition (DTD)? <em>[mwc: 100]</em></li>
              <li>A TEI which is valid according to the full 'tei_all.dtd' may still contain forms of encoding which are incompatible with the guidelines of specific research projects. Why is it necessary, in general, for individual studies to formulate project-specific guidelines? <em>[mwc: 200]</em></li>
              <li>TEI allows its DTD to be modified. Wat would be the chief disadvantage if the Book Trade Correspondence Project (to which you have made a contribution of one or more letters) decided to introduce modifications to the TEI DTD? What advantage(s) can you think of? <em>[mwc: 200]</em></li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
          </li>
          <li>The <a href="http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters.html">correspondence of Vincent van Gogh</a> has been encoded in XML, not unlike the Bohn-letters that you have been transcribing. Browse the website. What is the difference between full-text searching (for example using a web search engine) and using the <a href="http://vangoghletters.org/vg/advanced_search.html">advanced search option</a> to search for specific content in these letters? How does XML enable such advanced searches? What are its advantages? Would there also be occasions in which full-text search would be preferable? Explain. <em>[mwc: 300]</em></li>
