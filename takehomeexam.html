<h2>Digital Media Technology<br/>Take Home Exam</h2>

<strong>Due: 25 January 2018 to <a href="mailto:bdms.staff@gmail.com">bdms.staff@gmail.com</a></strong>


</p>
<p>
This Take Home Exam consists of three questions, for which a total of ten points may be awarded (allotment of points is specified per question). Each question should be answered in a mini-essay of specified length; please write in full sentences, cite references properly, and format one document in Docx according to the BDMS Style Sheet.
	</p>
<p> <strong>Question 1 – 1000 words, 5 points</strong></p>
<p>For the Take Home Exam of Digital Media Technology, you need to carry out a small research project in which you to attempt answer a research question using a raw data set which can be accessed online. The data set needs to be stored as a relational database.</p>
    <p>During the research project you need to move through the following phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Database design</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Select a raw data set and formulate a research question. Next, develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram for the data set.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Database implementation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Using the ERD as a basis, define a number of SQL CREATE statements which can implement the various entities which you had defined as tables. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data entry</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Obtain the data  from an online source and reorganise them in such a way that they can be entered into the database. Data is generally made available in the form of XML. Using XSLT stylesheets, convert the XML data into SQL INSERT statements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data analysis</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Use SQL to query the database and to produce visualisations which may help you to answer you central research question. </p>
    <p>In your research project, you may focus on the three raw datasets which are described on the following page:&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalscholarship.nl/DMT/Assignments/ResearchProject.html">https://digitalscholarship.nl/DMT/Assignments/ResearchProject.html</a><br>
      It is also allowed to work with a data set which is not in the list. Some inspiration can be found on the following websites:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh101f17/assignments/final-project/datasets/">Collection of data sets developed by Miriam Posner</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/c.php?g=337057&p=2272539">Quantitative Analysis: Humanities Datasets</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets">DH Toychest developed by Alan Liu</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>Write a brief essay in which you discuss your approach and in which you discuss the main findings of your research project.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
	<p> <strong>Question 2 – 5000 words, 2 points</strong></p>
The <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/">Walt Whitman Archive</a> is an online project, hosted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which offers access primary and secondary sources about the American poet, essayist and writer Walt Whitman (1819-1892). The archive demonstrates applications of  the technologies you have been taught about during DMT, as well as others you may not be familiar with. Explore the project, and answer the following questions in a running text.
<ul>
	<li>Which of the functionalities that you see on the website have (likely) been implemented using which technologies that have been discussed during DMT? Can you think of additional functionalities that could be implemented with these technologies?</li>
	<li>Which of the project’s functionalities go beyond the affordances of the technologies featured in DMT?</li>
	<li>Which features of the project do you find particularly striking? Why?</li>
	<li>Also analyse the rationale for creating the Walt Whitman Archive. Which new possibilities for research or access to source materials does it open up? For whom is the site intended?</li>
</ul>
	</p>


<strong>Question 3 – 500 w., 3 p. </strong>


Please read the following three texts:
<ul>
	<li>Fabio Ciotti & Francesca Tomasi, ‘Formal Ontologies, Linked Data, and TEI Semantics’, <em>Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative</em> 9 (2016), online, n.pag. DOI: 10.400/jtei.1480; URL: <a href="http://jtei.revues.org/1480">http://jtei.revues.org/1480</a>.</li>
	<li>Lou Burnard, ‘On the hermeneutic implications of text encoding’, in: Domenico Fiormonte & Jonathan Usher (eds.) <em>New Media and the Humanities: Research and Applications</em> (Oxford: Humanities Computing Unit, 2001), pp. 31-38. URL: <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/herman.htm">http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/herman.htm</a>.</li>
	<li>Allen Renear, David Durand & Elli Mylonas, 'Refining Our Notion of What Text Really Is: The Problem of Overlapping Hierarchies', in: Nancy Ide & Susan Hockey (eds.), <em>Research in Humanities Computing</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996); URL: <a href="http://cds.library.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html">http://cds.library.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html</a></li>
</ul>
According to you, which two aspects of the TEI standard can most seriously complicate its use within humanities research concentrating on texts? Motivate your answer and refer to this literature and/or other relevant materials from the course syllabus.
