<h2>Digital Media Technology<br/>Take Home Exam</h2>

<strong>Due: 25 January 2018 to <a href="mailto:bdms.staff@gmail.com">bdms.staff@gmail.com</a></strong>


</p>
<p>
This Take Home Exam consists of three questions, for which a total of ten points may be awarded (allotment of points is specified per question). Each question should be answered in a mini-essay of specified length; please write in full sentences, cite references properly, and format one document in Docx according to the BDMS Style Sheet.
	</p>
<p> <strong>Question 1 – 1000 words, 5 points</strong></p>
<p>

For the first question of the Take Home Exam of Digital Media Technology, you need to carry out a small research project in which you attempt to answer a research question on the basis of a relational database.
</p>
<p>
You can choose one of the following three data sets:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharedtaste.leidenuniv.nl/PHP/BDMS/nyt.html">Data about New York Times bestsellers, GoodReads reviews and literary awards.</a>
</li><li><a href="https://sharedtaste.leidenuniv.nl/PHP/BDMS/booktrade.html">Data about the Leiden booktrade in the early modern period</a>
</li><li>Data about graphic novels
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Use SQL to query the database and to produce visualisations which can help you to answer your central research question. Write a brief essay in which you explain your central question and in which you discuss the main findings of your research project.

</p>
	<p>
	<p> <strong>Question 2 – 500 words, 2 points</strong></p>
The <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/">Walt Whitman Archive</a> is an online project, hosted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which offers access primary and secondary sources about the American poet, essayist and writer Walt Whitman (1819-1892). The archive demonstrates applications of  the technologies you have been taught about during DMT, as well as others you may not be familiar with. Explore the project, and answer the following questions in a running text.
<ul>
	<li>Which of the functionalities that you see on the website have (likely) been implemented using which technologies that have been discussed during DMT? Can you think of additional functionalities that could be implemented with these technologies?</li>
	<li>Which of the project’s functionalities go beyond the affordances of the technologies featured in DMT?</li>
	<li>Which features of the project do you find particularly striking? Why?</li>
	<li>Also analyse the rationale for creating the Walt Whitman Archive. Which new possibilities for research or access to source materials does it open up? For whom is the site intended?</li>
</ul>
	</p>


<strong>Question 3 – 500 w., 3 p. </strong>


Please read the following three texts:
