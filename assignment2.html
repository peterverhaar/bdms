<body>
<p><strong>A. XSLT Stylesheet (50%).</strong></p>
<p>Create an XSLT stylesheet that can execute <a href="http://bookandbyte.org/DMT/index.php/assignment-2-scenarios/">the XML-transformation to an HTML-result that has been assigned to you</a>. Make sure the result-HTML file will be linked to, and therefore formatted accordingly to, the CSS stylesheet used on the Bookandbyte-website, which can be found at &lt;http://bookandbyte.org/style2007.css&gt;. Name your file [your surname]-DMT_Assignment2a.xsl, in accordance with the BDMS Style Sheet. Your XSL-file can be awarded a maximum of 10 points.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>B. Questions (50%).</strong></p>
<p>The questions test your understanding of the concepts and the techniques that have been explained in the Digital Media Technology lectures and seminars on XSLT, and/or before. Read all the questions very carefully and motivate your answers as fully as possible. The answers to these questions need to be given in a separate document. Do not forget to write your name in the document that you submit, and format the file in accordance with the BDMS Style Sheet.<br />
  The five questions can be awarded 2 points each.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which XPath expressions have you used in the stylesheet that you have written for part A of this assignment? Name at least three, and briefly explain their function. <em><em>[maximum word count (mwc): 150]</em></em><br/><br/></li>
  <li>To publish a TEI XML file on the web, it is usually transformed into HTML, with XSLT. An alternative publication scenario could be to encode the text directly in HTML and style it with CSS, without having to create a an XSLT to transform the XML. What advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) adhere to both scenarios? <em><em>[mwc: 300]</em></em>
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> and <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> are two reference management applications, with which users can easily display sources in various citation styles, based on stored metadata. Below you can find three examples of this: in the first example (i), the article is cited according to the style of the American Psychological Association (APA); in the second example (ii), the citation follows the rules of the Modern Language Association (MLA); the third example (iii) adheres to the BDMS Stylesheet.<br />
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Schreibman, S., Gueguen, G., &amp; Roper J., (2008). Cross-collection Searching: A Pandora's Box or the Holy Grail', Literary and Linguistics Computing, 23 (1), 13-25.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Explain how XML and XSLT techniques can be used on these reference management applications to implement such a functionality. Which XSLT elements would you need to make sure any citation style can be precisely followed? Tip: Note that not all sources have multiple authors, or pagination. <em>[maximum word count: 200]</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Explain the difference between 'statements' and 'flow control components' in programming languages. In which category would you place &lt;xsl:for-each&gt;?<br/><br/></li>
  <li>According to you and/or based on your own experience, which aspect(s) of XSLT is/are most difficult for new learners of the language? Illustrate your argumentation with material from the <a href="https://digitalscholarship.nl/DMT/Exercises/XSLT-Exercises.html">XSLT Exercises</a>. <em>[maximum word count: 200]</em></li>
